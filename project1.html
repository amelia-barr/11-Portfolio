                    My character is a wizard with a stocky build usually hidden behind a cape/robe, I will be making this character in blender, creating a mesh figure and then rigging and animating idle and running animations. 
                    Eventually this character will be implemented into a game in the following terms.

                    The end users for this project would be anyone looking at this model or playing the game that this character will be implemented in. 
                    Anyone playing the game and seeing/playing as this character will be an end user. 
                    Another end user could also be potential employers looking at my past projects.

                <p>
                    For my character's Requirements and Specifications I set three general requirements that I wanted my character to fit into, firstly my character's proportions have to be as accurate as possible, not deviating from normal human anatomy. 
                    Secondly my character should look as close to my turnaround as possible without deviating from normal human proportions. 
                    Lastly, my character has to have fluid looking animations and movements. 
                    As well as these requirements, I made specifications adding onto them, like my character has to be decently tall, and they also have to have a topheavy build. 
                    These requirements and specifications will help me add to the stylisation and realism of my character.

                <p>
                    For the relevant implications of my character, I considered aesthetics, functionality, and usability. 
                    Aesthetically, I gave my character a robe and staff to reflect their wizard role, choosing colors that suit their clothing and accessories. 
                    For functionality, I imagined how the character would fight and move, going for a bulkier build to convey the weight of the staff and robe whilst still justifying their quick and agile movements. 
                    Lastly, for usability, I thought about how the character should be animated and how fast they should move and also how their abilities would be displayed and unlocked when implemented into the game.
